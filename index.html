  <h3>Abstract </h3>
</header>
<p> &nbsp; &nbsp;UFO catcher is indubitably the symbol of Japanese arcade. Based on these machines, we are aiming to make a device with similar function using DNA origami that has the potential to capture and release tiny particles. The goal of this project is to create a DNA structure that can capture and release materials such as virus and protein, but not limited to these two. </p>

<h3>Problem</h3>
<p> &nbsp; &nbsp;Analytical methods have been proposed for detection of different ligands such as proteins through ELISA or nucleic acids through microarrays. However, for the most part, these methods can be costly and impractical. Through recent advancements, aptamers, or what is equivalent to nucleic acid based antibodies have been an exciting prospect in analysis of different ligands such as proteins and even inorganic or organic molecules. This project aims to combine this technique with swarming behaviour of nanorobots to enable more efficient response and possibly anlytical technique that can analyze multiple ligands at a time.</p>

	</center></p>
	<p> &nbsp; &nbsp;Therefore, to address to that problem, by using DNA origami,  we designed a structure that can capture viruses. As a comparison, by applying  pesticides to weeds, some might acquire resistance and the pesticides will not  be effective anymore, however by physically removing the weeds down to the  root, there is no chance for the weeds to show resistance.&nbsp; </p>

</center>
<p> &nbsp; &nbsp;In this project, we took the concept of UFO catcher, or  mostly known as claw machines. However, even though the root concept of the  project is similar, we modified the “claw” part to strengthen the ability to  capture molecules.</p>
<h3>goals</h3>
<p> &nbsp; &nbsp;The aim of this project is to prove that this mechanism is a  feasible way to catch particles. Even though a method of recognition of  molecules might be needed to claim that the structure is applicable, the target  of the research at this stage is to simply proof that this method is possible. </p>

</figure>
<p>The flow of our project is classified into 5 major points. <br>
  1. Design of DNA origami by caDNAno.<br>
  2. Simulate the behaviour using Cando.<br>
  3. Folding of DNA origami. <br>
  4a. Confirmation of the completion of structure using AFM.<br>
  4b. Confirmation of the movement through FRET <br>
  5. Confirmation of magnetically driven movement through FRET.<br>
  <br>
  &nbsp; &nbsp;In this project, all of the objectives until step 4a and 4b has been completed. The designed UFO catcher was constructed correctly and the FRET signal was observed as expected.</p>
