						<h3>Problem</h3>
<p> &nbsp; &nbsp;Analytical methods have been proposed for detection of different ligands such as proteins through ELISA or nucleic acids through microarrays. However, for the most part, these methods can be costly and impractical. Through recent advancements, aptamers, or what is equivalent to nucleic acid based antibodies have been an exciting prospect in analysis of different ligands such as proteins and even inorganic or organic molecules. This project aims to combine this technique with swarming behaviour of nanorobots to enable more efficient response and possibly analytical technique that can analyze multiple ligands at a time.</p>
</figcaption></center>
</figure>
<p>The flow of our project is classified into 5 major points. <br>
  1. Design of DNA origami by caDNAno and manually for connecting staples.<br>
  2. Simulation of the designed structure in solution using Cando.<br>
  3. Folding of DNA origami. <br>
  4. Confirmation of the completion of structure using AFM.<br>
  5. Confirmation of swarming through AFM <br>
  <br>
  &nbsp; &nbsp;In this project, the design of the connecting staples defines the swarming effect of the nanorobots. At first, only simpler techniques will be used to create connection and to prove the stability of the connection between the robot monomers. At the later stage of the experiment, nanorobots will be able to respond to external stimuli such as specific ligands that can induce swarming and detect presence of ligands.</p>

									  <p> &nbsp; &nbsp;In this section, the first 2 goals of the experiments were attempted. The first goal is to anneal the monomer correctly and to perform a strand exchange process to connect the monomers to form dimers and assess the stability of this connection.</p>
									  <header>
									    <h3>annealing the monomers </h3>
									  </header>
															  
									  
									  <ol>
									    <li>1. 10x of 2ul MgCl2 buffer with MgCl2 concentration of 0, 5, 8 ,10, 12, 15, 20mM were used to determine the correct folding condition.</li>
									    <li>2. To this buffer, 2ul of staple mix needed to form monomers were added to the previously prepared buffer with 8ul of m13mp18. 8ul of pure water was then added to create a mixture of 20ul in total. 7 tubes containing this mixture were made depending on the concentration of MgCl2 </li>
									    <li>3. The mixtures were then prepared for annealing by putting in PCR machine at 85C for 5 minutes and followed by cooling to 25C at 0.2C/min for 5 hours.</li>
									    <li>4. The resulting mixture was then put into gel electrophoresis to check if the annealing has completed.</li>
									    
									  </ol> 
									  
									  
									  
									  <header>
									    <h3>replacing the staples </h3>
									  </header>
										<p>The next procedure involves adding additional staples that can form base pairing more thermodynamically stable so that some of the previous staples get replaced by these staples and form dimers.</p>
									  <ol>
									    <li>1. As from the previous experiments, the 10mM and 12mM showed to be the ones that seemed to have annealed better, mixtures from these 2 samples were used in the following methods.</li>
										  <li>2. From these mixtures, SpinColumn S-300 was used to separate the properly annealed monomers from the DNA strands that did not anneal properly.</li>
										  <li>3. 2 50ml of 18nM of purified triangles was purified using this technique. </li>
										  <li>4. 1.8ml of 500nM replacement strands was then added to each 50ml solutions. Furthermore, 1.8 pure water was also added</li>
										  <li>5. As activation energy was needed to initiate replacement of strands, temperature gradient was setup and split into 5 conditions: 25C, 29.37C, 35.12C, 40.64C, and 44.09C.</li>
										  <li>6. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was then used to observe the structures if the dimers had formed.</li>
