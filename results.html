	       <p>The objective of this section is to decide the perfect condition for monomer annealing. There are different aspects to annealing the perfect monomer: MgCl2 concentration, temperature, and annealing time.</p>

           <p></p>
    <h2 class="page-header" id="sec1-1">Annealing of monomer - Deciding MgCl2 concentration</h2>
            <p>For this part, it did not take a lot of trials to find the perfect annealing condition as the design is 2D and has been well documented. The temperature gradient used in annealing is as seen in fig 1.1 while the gel electrophoresis result of the different MgCl2 concentrations can be seen on fig 1.2.</p>

The structure is an equivalent of about 5700 BP dsDNA, however it can be seen that the upper less darker band is at around 4 kb. This might have been influenced by the structure shape, which causes the flow through the gel to be different than predicted. Furthermore, the 2 bands in the lanes might also be caused by the monomers taking different conformations.</p>

    <h2 class="page-header" id="sec2-0">Connection design overview</h2>
            <p>
                After successful of monomer annealing, we moved to the next target: 
establishing the connection between the monomers.
            </p>
            <p>
                Firstly, the first connection design is based on toe-hold method: 
replacing monomer’s existing staple strands to the ones that are more 
thermodynamically stable. 
            </p>
            <p>
Second, we tried complementary strands methods: protruding staple 
strands that have weak secondary structures and can make stable 
connection with the counter partners.            </p>
            <p>
                Third, we tried the bridge method: protruding strands that are not 
complementary, but can be connected by the bridge strands.
            </p>

    <h2 class="page-header" id="sec2">First connection - Incubation temperature</h2>
            <p>
                For the first connection design, the bridge strands were added at a ratio of monomer:bridge 2:1. These strands were added, and the monomers were incubated at a certain constant temperature for 4 hours. Fig 2.1. and fig 2.2. show the results of annealing at MgCl2 concentration of 10 and 12 MgCl2 concentration respectively.

                Connection design 2 (3T) was used to induce polymerization by having protruding strands on 3 of the sides of the triangle monomers. The results of polymerization are shown in fig 7.3a and b. From fig 7.3a, we can see that there are clearly heavier bands where monomers with protruding strands are present in the solution, which means that a degree of polymerization has occured. The AFM image taken is available on fig 7.4, the image did not clearly show polymerization, but a degree of clustering has occured.

               The trigger mechanism was annealed based on the condition specified. As seen in fig 8.1, sheet with protruding strands showed a more pronounced larger band. This probably happened due to the strands affecting the flow of the sheets through the gel. By looking at lane 3 to 5, it was possible that the fasteners were not able to fasten the sheets and form a tube and thus means that more experiments might be needed to confirm the closing by fasteners.

                AFM observation as shown in fig 8.3a showed that the sheets have annealed properly to form rectangular sheets of proper size. Moreover, the protruding strands were also visible and rough ImageJ intensity analysis were done for 28 sample structures and that the result is shown in fig 8.3b. However, it can be seen that there were no structure possessing 6 strands as designed, this might have been caused as the protruding strands were not large enough and uniform enough to form a point that is detectable by AFM. The structures that were observed to have none protruding strands were possibly due to the orientation of the structures where the protruding strands face the other side.

                For the trigger mechanism, we succeeded in closing the sheet to prevent the monomers from aggregating before activation.
                The trigger mechanism was also designed by using single stranded DNA as a key and anti-key, not using protein as its intended function. Therefore, more experiments might be needed to confirm the feasibility of triggering the structure through protein binding. Nevertheless, Li et al. has shown that this mechanism is feasible and possibly needs readjustment of the annealing conditions.

        Overall conclusions and discussions
    </h2>
            <p style="text-align: left;">
                Firstly, we have succeeded in establishing the design of the monomer. The design of the monomer also has side staple strands that can be modified to make way for elongated staple strands that can be used to make connections to polymerize the structures. The results as seen in figure 1.3a and 1.3b shows that the monomer is rather stable in solution. Nevertheless, more experiments with different monomer shapes might be required for different tasks such as those needing higher surface area or more point of contact between monomers. This means that we have completed our first goal which is to establish a functional monomer.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: left;">
                Moreover, we have established the connection needed to form dimers to a certain efficiency. Efficiency of the connections might be raised by using protruding strands that have a higher G-C content and the length of the connections. Moreover, polymerization was also achieved using connection design 2 with 3T spacers in the protruding strands. The result of this section means that we have realized our next goal in establishing means of connection between the monomers. 
            </p>

            <p style="text-align: left;">
                We have also succeeded in closing the adapter part by addition of fastener, this trigger design can also be triggered by protein in which was not performed in our project. Nevertheless, we have proven that the adapter/trigger design can be used to initiate polymerization upon activation. 
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: left;">
                However, we have not established a system that is ready for practical use in which the system can work as a group to maintain the concentration of a target molecule at a certain target location. Nevertheless, this project aims to establish the basics needed in realizing a working swarm nanorobot system that has been proven to be feasible through the experiments performed.
